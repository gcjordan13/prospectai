    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to support the Prospector AI application's core features, focusing on secure access to user-specific data and efficient querying. The structure prioritizes authorization independence, enabling robust security rules without relying on hierarchical `get()` calls. User-owned data, such as Prospecting Goals, are stored within user-specific subcollections (e.g., `/users/{userId}/prospectingGoals/{prospectingGoalId}`), providing clear ownership and simplified security rules. Prospects, related to Prospecting Goals, follow a similar nested structure for the same reasons. This structure allows listing all prospecting goals for a user and all prospects for a given prospecting goal. The design supports QAPs by segregating data based on ownership and providing clear path-based authorization. The denormalization strategy isn't required here because the data does not involve collaborative entities, and ownership is derived directly from the document paths."
